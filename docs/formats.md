# Available Formats

The app comes with several out of the box formats. Each format comes with two variants. The **WEB** variant has links that can take you back to the recovery site. The **PRINT**  variant (no links, black/white) to use in your home printer. You can set your config to print but by default it's the web variant.

Here are the available formats to download for the Baltimore intergroup
